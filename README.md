# Cinema

Desktop app made in Windows Forms for booking tickets for cinema movies. (NET FRAMEWORK 4.6)


# FUNCTIONALITY:

This application is designed for two types of users, admin and basic user.

As an admin user, you will have access to a range of management functionalities. You can manage movies and their projections, including setting the date, ticket price, and projection type (2D or 3D). Additionally, you can administrate movie theaters and the seats within them.

As a basic user, you can browse and view all projections for all films. You can also make reservations for specific seats, giving you the power to plan your cinema experience in advance.

# FUTURE PLANS:

I am currently in the process of expanding this app into a web application. With this new development, the app will be even more accessible and user-friendly, thanks to the use of React on the frontend and ASP.NET Core as the backend
